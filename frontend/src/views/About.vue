    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      Experienced frontend developer with a strong background in TypeScript and Vue, has been
      involved in the migration from Vue 2 to Vue 3 and transitioning state management from Vuex to
      Pinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Skilled in planning, breaking down, and delivering high-quality features while collaborating
      closely with UX and backend teams. Recognized for strong communication skills, a hands-on
      problem-solving mindset, and a continuous drive to explore new technologies. Quickly adapts to
      new challenges and enjoys working in fast-paced, evolving environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time, I enjoy spending countless hours in Home Assistant, automating lightbulbs to
      save the 2 seconds it takes to press a light switch. My passion for home automation has also
      led me to 3D printingâ€”building custom sensors using ESP-32 devices and designing and printing
      cases for them.
